```

```js preview-story
export const main = () => html`
  <lion-steps>
    <lion-step initial-step>
      Step 1
      <button type="button" @click=${ev => ev.target.parentElement.controller.next()}>Next</button>
    </lion-step>
    <lion-step>
      <button type="button" @click=${ev => ev.target.parentElement.controller.previous()}>
        Previous
      </button>
      Step 2
      <button type="button" @click=${ev => ev.target.parentElement.controller.next()}>
        Next
      </button></lion-step
    >
    <lion-step>
      <button type="button" @click=${ev => ev.target.parentElement.controller.previous()}>

- options
  - **initial-step**: Set to the first step of the flow, blocks calling `previous` function.
  - **condition**: Dynamic condition, when true the step is added to the flow.
  - **invert-condition**: Inverts the condition set.

In many application you build multi-step workflows like multi-step forms where you want to split a long process into smaller steps making easier user's perception of it and making easier filling in data. The idea of this component is to provide a simple way to define such steps and transition from one to another while saving data between them and conditionally skip some steps based on the data.
